some cinema 4d work i've recently done and decided to:
- opensource as a portfolio for future commissions
- if you want to hire 2 work for you: 
  - selfdeterminedhermit [at] gmail [dot] com
- i can make you like 50-200 shapes as prototypes at the level of these for like 150-225 euros
- I will finish the work in about one or two weeks

#### ideal 2 pass throughout some presets in arnold, octane, or vray, or to render with ue4, unity, cryengine or lumberyard
